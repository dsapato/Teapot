Hello all!

-I'm Danny Sapato.
I was working with code that came from Jason L. McKesson's tutorial online, found at http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html

-Sorry that I used an existing set of files, it makes compiling a bit ugly.

-source.cpp has my code, it's modified from mountain.cpp

-To compile, you view the folder from the terminal and use the command "premake4 clean" and "premake4 plat", where plat is what application you will use. Mine was "premake4 codeblocks".

-The executable is called "mp3" here in the main folder
